        "React Hooks revolutionized how we write components in React by allowing us to use state and other React features without writing classes. The useState hook is the most basic hook that lets you add React state to function components.",
        "The useEffect hook combines the functionality of componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount in class components. It lets you perform side effects in function components. You can use it for data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM.",
        "Other essential hooks include useContext for accessing context, useReducer for more complex state logic, and useCallback/useMemo for performance optimizations. Custom hooks let you extract component logic into reusable functions.",
        "When adopting Hooks, remember to only call them at the top level of your component (not inside loops or conditions) and only from React function components or custom Hooks."

        "CSS Grid Layout is a powerful two-dimensional layout system that lets you create complex web designs with ease. Unlike Flexbox which is one-dimensional, Grid allows precise control over both rows and columns simultaneously.",
        "To start using Grid, you define a grid container with display: grid. Then you can use grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows to establish your grid structure. The fr unit represents a fraction of the available space.",
        "Grid items can be precisely placed using grid-column and grid-row properties. The grid-area property provides a shorthand for placement. You can also create named grid areas for more readable layouts.",
        "Advanced features include auto-placement, alignment controls, and responsive design with media queries. Grid works perfectly with other layout methods like Flexbox - they complement each other rather than compete."

        "WebAssembly (Wasm) is a low-level binary format that runs at near-native speed in browsers. It complements JavaScript for performance-critical tasks like games, image/video processing, and scientific computing.",
        "Wasm modules are compiled from languages like C/C++, Rust, or Go. They interact with JavaScript through a well-defined API. Memory is managed manually (unlike JS) but languages like Rust provide safety.",
        "Use cases include: performance-sensitive code, porting existing applications to web, and isolating security-sensitive code. The WASI initiative is expanding WebAssembly beyond the browser.",
        "Tools like Emscripten compile C/C++ to Wasm. The Rust ecosystem has excellent Wasm support through wasm-pack. Debugging is possible with browser devtools and source maps."
